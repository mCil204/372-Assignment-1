    <h1>A Look Through my Window, Cil</h1>

    <h2>Hello!</h2>
    <p> Welcome to my travel blog. This is where I keep all of my experiences and adventures from all the around the
        world so that you may experience them yourself.</p>

    <h2> My Experiences</h2>
    <p>Through my travels and adventures, I have found that travelling enriches our minds (and our stomachs), when we
        experience new things. Each new place I visit teaches me something new about that world and about myself.</p>

    <h2> Recent Trip: Thailand</h2>
    <p>The newest place I experienced was <strong>Phuket, Thailand</strong>. This island offers delicious food, beautiful beaches, and a
        rich culture to immerse yourself in. I spent my time there walking through temples, eating local foods, and
        watched my first ever <em>Muay Thai</em> match live in a stadium!</p>

    <p>And as always, happy and safe travels!</p>
